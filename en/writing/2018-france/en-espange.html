<br><br>
During the last vacation, I went to Valencia in Spain. It was a trip with my colleagues at school, in order to participate in a collaborative workshop with the students in the Valencian art school. However, it was difficult to develop a project because one member in my group did not want to commit herself to creating art. In fact, she did not want to commit herself to a collaborative project. Besides, I think that this workshop was not for us, but for our school. It is different.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, it was interesting to rediscover my colleagues in a new environment. I spent a little time with two colleagues. We ate, walked and talked. We celebrated one colleague’s birthday. In a good restaurant, we talked about our lives in Paris, and got to know each other better. This time was agreeable. 
<br><br>
After the workshop, I left from Valencia, and went to Logroño, a city in Northern Spain, located on Camino de Santiago. I had missed this way, where I had walked four years ago. While walking again, I was able to feel a person whom I was in the past and to notice the changes caused by time. It was a good opportunity to reflect.
<br><br>
Even though I spent just three days on Camino de Santiago, I was able to recharge my spirit. My body became dure. Therefore, my spirit became pure. The people on the way, they were ready to help each other. It is Camino de Santiago.
